## Abstract
The vocal activity and detectability of tropical birds are subject to high levels of temporal heterogeneity, but quantifying fine-grain patterns of diel and day-to-day variation in complex systems is challenging with traditional point-count methods. As a result, research concerning stochastic temporal effects on tropical avian assemblages is limited, typically offering only broad conclusions, e.g., that overall activity is highest in the first few hours of the morning and that some species are active at different times of day. Passive acoustic monitoring introduces several advantages for studying temporal variation, particularly by enabling simultaneous and continuous data collection across adjacent sites. Here, we employed autonomous recording units to quantify temporal variation in avian vocal activity levels and observed species richness at an Amazonian reserve in Madre de Dios, Peruâ€”a region featuring some of Earth's richest, most complex avian assemblages. We manually annotated 18 dawn hour recordings, collected simultaneously from three separate days at the same six sites, which represent a variety of microhabitats and avian community compositions. We documented significant and consistent temporal variation in avian vocal activity levels and observed species richness within the dawn hour and across days. We found that temporal effects were stronger for vocal activity than for observed species richness and that diel activity patterns varied on a species-to-species basis at a fine scale. Our results indicate that overlooked temporal variation in Amazonian soundscapes may obfuscate the results of surveys that fail to sufficiently account for temporal variables with simultaneous monitoring. Further research concerning the automated processing of acoustic data could lead to more efficient methods for reducing temporal bias and improving the calibration and accuracy of ornithological surveys in the tropics.

Welcome to our open-access repository for Hopping et al. (2023), submitted to IBIS. Here you will find all of the materials necessary to reproduce the results published in the manuscript. 1-Main-Script-Sayers.R pulls in the bioacoustic data frames from Raven Pro 1.6 and calculates all relevant response variables (e.g., species richness), and 2-Models-Sayers.R builds the GAMs, performs the NMDS analysis, and produces the published figures.
